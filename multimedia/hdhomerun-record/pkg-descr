HDHomeRun DVR by SiliconDust is a personal video recorder
that aims to simplify and change the way we watch and record
live television.

This port provides the HDHomeRun RECORD engine, a daemon
that streams live TV from a compatible HDHomeRun tuner and
records the stream to disk. Recordings can be scheduled and
viewed using front-ends such as Kodi (with the HDHomeRun
add-on) and SiliconDust's HDHomeRun VIEW app for Windows,
Android, and Mac.

The recording engine requires a compatible hardware tuner
(e.g. HDHomeRun PRIME, CONNECT, EXTEND), as well as enough
disk space for storing recordings.
