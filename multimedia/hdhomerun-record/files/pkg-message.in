IMPORTANT: You must specify where to store recordings before the
recording engine can be used. A sample configuration file has been
provided that you must manually copy and edit, like so:

	cd %%ETCDIR%%
	cp %%BINNAME%%.conf.sample %%BINNAME%%.conf
	ee %%BINNAME%%.conf

Change the value of the `RecordPath' setting to the full path to the
desired recording directory. If such directory does not already exist,
you must first create it manually. The recording engine will store log
files here as well.

Once configured, enable the HDHomeRun recording service by adding the
following line to /etc/rc.conf:

	%%PORTNAME%%_enable="YES"

To start the service immediately, run:

	service %%PORTNAME%% start

If the service has started successfully, you will find a log file in
the recording directory.

NOTE: If you have a firewall or packet filter, you must allow inbound
UDP traffic on port 65001 to make discovery possible.
